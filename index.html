		<h1> Welcome to PLD450 Project Home Page </h1>
		<h2> Is Your Technology Environment Safe? </h2>
		<p> It's best to assume that every internet connected environment is being probed or attacked 
by some bad actor.  The catch here is, is your environment protected?  In many cases, the unfortunate answer to 
this question is, no.  Do you know why?	Every user holds a key to the information that bad actors are seeking.<br>
Here are some methods used to infiltrate your environment: 	</p>
<p>Worms are spread via software vulnerabilities or phishing attacks. Once a worm has installed itself into your computer’s memory, it starts to infect the whole machine and in some cases… your whole network.</p>
<p>Unlike worms, viruses need an already-infected active operating system or program to work. Viruses are typically attached to an executable file or a word document.
<p>A bot is a computer that’s been infected with malware so it can be controlled remotely by a hacker.

That bot (aka a zombie computer), can then be used to launch more attacks or to become part of a collection of bots (aka a botnet).

Botnets are popular with hacker show-offs (the more bots you collect, the mightier a hacker you are) and cyber criminals spreading ransomware. Botnets can include millions of devices as they spread undetected.</p>
<p>Just as it sounds, a Trojan Horse is a malicious program that disguises itself as a legitimate file. Because it looks trustworthy, users download it and… hey presto, in storms the enemy.</p>
<p>Ransomware denies or restricts access to your own files. Then it demands payment (usually with crypto-currencies) in return for letting you back in.

In May 2017, a ransomware attack spread across 150 countries and compromised over 200k computers within just one day. Aptly named WannaCry, the attack caused damage estimated in the hundreds of millions to billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Adware is one of the better-known types of malware. It serves pop-ups and display ads that often have no relevance to you.

Some users will put up with certain types of adware in return for free software (games for example). But not all adware is equal. At best, it’s annoying and slows down your machine. At worst, the ads link to sites where malicious downloads await unsuspecting users. Adware can also deliver Spyware and is often easily hacked, making devices that have it installed a soft target for hackers, phishers and scammers.</p>
<p>Spyware secretly records your online activity, harvesting your data and collecting personal information such as usernames, passwords and surfing habits.

Spyware is a common threat, usually distributed as freeware or shareware that has an appealing function on the front end with a covert mission running in the background that you might never notice. It’s often used to carry out identity theft and credit card fraud.

Once on your computer, spyware relays your data to advertisers or cyber criminals. Some spyware installs additional malware that make changes to your settings.</p>
<p>Phishing is a type of social engineering attack, rather than a type of malware. But is a common method of cyber attack. Phishing is successful since the emails sent, text messages and web links created look like they’re from trusted sources. They’re sent by criminals to fraudulently acquire personal and financial information.

Some are highly sophisticated and can fool even your most savvy users. Especially in cases where a known contact’s email account has been compromised and it appears you’re getting an instruction from your boss or IT colleagues. Others are less sophisticated and simply spam as many emails as they can with a message about ‘checking your bank account details’.</p>

<p>Most people are probably aware that a .exe file extension could lead to issues if it’s not from a trusted source. But there are hundreds of other file extensions that denote an executable file.

Usually spread via infected websites, file sharing, or email attachment downloads, a virus will lie dormant until the infected host file or program is activated. Once that happens, the virus is able to replicate itself and spread through your systems.

For computer viruses, your contact list is the equivalent of a packed train for the common cold. It hijacks your applications and uses your own apps to sneeze all over everyone… sending out infected files to your colleagues, friends and clients. Because it looks like it’s coming from a trustworthy source (you!), it has a much higher chance of spreading.</p>
